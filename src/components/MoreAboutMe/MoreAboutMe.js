          <Answer>
            For be honest I hate questions like - 'Tell us something about yourself', Cmone! What the fuck I suppose to tell about myself? Have you so
            interesting life that you could answer that question anyhing more than couple boring words? "Im X years old, my interested in this and
            that ", you expect me to tell story of my life? I'dont know you! If you really wanna know who am I we shoud hang out for a beer! All of
            necessary informations are in my resume.

          <Header>How I learned those things?</Header>
          <Answer>
            Thats a better question! Mostly I've learned things from tutorials and courses, documentation is also a good lecture. I will not lie to
            you! I'm not 24/7 learner and I've got lazy days but when I have a problem, I will sit on my ass until I will solve it! Determination is
            my second name.

            Just joking...

            I've always wanna be someone, but for a long time I didnt knew what i wanna do for the rest of my life. One day, two years ago I was
            watching youtube and I found a guy who was recording vlogs about programming. Then something touched me that I can be programmer, it's
            hard they said... But you dont need math they said.
            <br />
            <br />
            So!
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm in!

          <Header>Why shoud you hire me?</Header>
          <Answer>
            That's your decision but I can guarantee you that I wanna change my life and nothing cant stop me. If you'll not hire me thats not a big
            deal cause I will search for a job as long as I will get one. I'm really enjoing programming and I'm hungry for a learning new things. I
            wanna sink in that programming swamp!
